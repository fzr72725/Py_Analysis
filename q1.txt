Our archaeologist might therefore look at the Americas and conclude 
that Africans, despite their apparently enormous head start, would have 
been overtaken by the earliest Americans within at most a millennium. 
Thereafter, the Americas' greater area (50 percent greater than Africa's) 
and much greater environmental diversity would have given the advantage 
to Native Americans over Africans.

Python nite:
1. List comprehension:
result = [x+10 for x in my_list]

a = list('abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz')
b = list('phqgiumeaylnofdxjkrcvstzwb')
d = {x:y for x,y in zip(a,b)}

2. File operation:
my_file = open('hello.txt')
t = my_file.read()

# function strip is to remove \n
[l.strip() for l in my_file]

3. word/letter counter:
from collections import Counter
c = Counter(content)
* output is a dictionary

4. Set:
my_set = set(content)
* set is to have a unique element collection

5. Dictionary:
my_dict = dict((key,0) for key in my_set)

6. Other operation:
m += 1

string.lower()

function join is to turn a list into a string connected with specific char('' is no connector)
''.join(list)

print [x for x in range (1,5)]
*[1, 2, 3, 4]
